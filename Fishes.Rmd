## Galiano Island's marine fish diversity

*‘Actinopterygii’ is formed from the Latin 'actino-', “having rays”, and the Ancient Greek πτέρυξ (ptérux), meaning “wings” or “fins.” ‘Chondrichthyes’ comes from the Greek χόνδρος (khóndros), meaning "cartilage", and ἰχθύς (ikhthū́s), meaning "fish".*

Actinopterygii contain over 33,000 described taxa and Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish) over 1,100 taxa, including both freshwater and marine species. Over 1,500 marine species are estimated to occur between the Beaufort Sea, Alaska, to the tip of Baja California, Mexico and over 400 species reported for Canadian waters in the Northeast Pacific. To date, `r nrow(fishes.summary)` species of ray-finned and cartilaginous fish have been reported for Galiano Island, through the combined efforts of more than `r length(unique(fishes$recordedBy))` individuals.

[Rockfish](#taxon:Sebastinae) are a long-lived and diverse genus of fish in the Northeast Pacific, 11 of which are represented in the Galiano Island record. Species present include the threatened quillback rockfish ([*Sebastes maliger*](#taxon:Sebastes maliger)) and yellow-eye rockfish ([*S. ruberrimus*](#taxon:Sebastes ruberrimus)), the latter of which is ranked as a species of special concern in Canada. This species may attain large sizes (~ 1 m, 12.6 kg). However, as with other species in the genus, it is slow to mature and reproduce and is, therefore, vulnerable to overfishing and fatality due to barotrauma from catch and release. As a consequence, many species of *Sebastes* are at low levels of abundance in the region. Spatially-managed rockfish conservation areas that remain permanently closed to all fishing and extraction activities are vital to ensure their recovery.

## Community science contributions

Since the Biodiversity Galiano project began in 2016, our community has documented `r nrow(observed)` fish species in the waters around Galiano Island, [confirming](#region:confirmed) `r round((nrow(confirmed)/(nrow(confirmed)+nrow(reported))*100), digits = 0)` percent of the [historical records](#region:historical) and adding `r nrow(new)` [new species](#region:new) to the list. Of the `r nrow(reported) + nrow(confirmed)` historically reported taxa, `r nrow(reported)` species remain unconfirmed, having gone unreported in the last twenty years.

Marine fishes dwell in various habitats, from deep sea (pelagic) to near-shore and intertidal environments. Taxa under-represented in this dataset include cartilaginous fish (chondrichthyes), hagfish (myxinids) and smelts (osmerids). These gaps reflect search efforts mostly biased toward rocky reefs and exposed beach locales, to waters < 30 m in depth. Poachers (agonids), right-eyed flounders ([pleuronectids](#taxon:Pleuronectidae)) and eelpouts (zoarcids) are also under-represented. These are primarily subtidal, soft substrate inhabitants, indicating that sampling has been limited in these habitats. 

We can look to nearby records to get a sense for other species that may be expected locally. For example, the near-threatened bluntnose sixgill shark (*Hexanchus griseus*) is known from adjacent waters around Mayne Island, BC. This species likely occurs around Galiano Island, though it has not yet been reported locally.
