## Galiano Island's marine mammal diversity

*The name ‘Mammalia’ was coined in 1758 by Linnaeus, from Late Latin (neuter plural) 'mammalis', meaning “of the breast.”*

Mammalia are a class of vertebrates containing 6,400 species worldwide. Within British Columbia, 31 marine mammal species are represented among two orders, including [Carnivora](#taxon:Carnivora) (carnivores) and [Cetacea](#taxon:Cetacea) (cetaceans). Twenty-two marine mammals have been documented within the Salish Sea, including fifteen cetaceans, five species of pinniped and two mustelids. Of these taxa, `r nrow(mammals.summary)` marine mammal have been reported in waters around Galiano Island to date, through the combined efforts of more than `r length(unique(mammals$recordedBy))` individuals.

Among locally occurring cetaceans are: baleen whales, distinguished by their enlarged head containing baleen plates suspended from the upper jaw, their double blowhole and their thick blubber; and toothed whales, distinguished by their teeth and single external blowhole. Certain cetaceans, such as fin whale ([*Balaenoptera physalus*](#taxon:Balaenoptera physalus)) and common minke whale ([*Balaenoptera acutorostrata*](#taxon:Balaenoptera acutorostrata)) have been recorded infrequently in local waters, whereas others, such as humpback whale ([*Megaptera novaeangliae*](#taxon:Megaptera novaeangliae)) and harbour porpoise ([*Phocoena phocoeana*](#taxon:Phocoena phocoeana)), are commonly seen. Among carnivores, both aquatic pinnipeds, such as harbour seal ([*Phoca vitulina*](#taxon:Phoca vitulina)) and semi-aquatic fissipeds, such as river otter ([*Lontra canadensis*](#taxon:Lontra canadensis)), are represented. Presently, there are no known haulouts of northern elephant seal (*Mirounga angustirostris*) around Galiano Island, though they are known not far away on Salt Spring Island.

Populations of grey whale ([*Eschrichtius robustus*](#taxon:Eschrichtius robustus)), [humpback whale](#taxon:Megaptera novaeangliae), [harbour porpoise](#taxon:Phocoena phocoeana) and the southern resident orca population ([*Orcinus orca*](#taxon:Orcinus orca)) are currently ranked as species of conservation concern in the region. Northern resident, transient and offshore orcas are also known to traverse local waters and are listed as threatened within Canada.

## Community science contributions

Since the Biodiversity Galiano project began in 2016, our community has documented `r nrow(observed)` marine mammal species in the waters around Galiano Island, [confirming](#region:confirmed) all historical records and adding `r nrow(new)` [new](#region:new) species to the list.
