## Galiano Island's crustacean diversity

*The name ‘Crustacea’ is rooted in the Modern Latin 'crusta', meaning “shell.”*

Crustacea are a highly diverse subphylum of Arthropoda that contains over 52,000 described terrestrial, marine and freshwater species. This subphylum includes six classes, three of which are represented locally: [Hexanauplia](#taxon:Hexanauplia) (barnacles, copepods and tantulocarids); [Ichthyostraca](#taxon:Ichthyostraca) (fish lice); and [Malacostraca](#taxon:Malacostraca) (amphipods, crabs, isopods, krill and shrimp). Over 900 marine crustacean species are known to occur in British Columbia. Of these, `r nrow(crustacean.summary)` species have been reported for Galiano Island, through the combined efforts of more than `r length(unique(crustaceans$recordedBy))` individuals.

Numerous non-native crustaceans are known to the region, though only one introduced species is currently represented in the Galiano Island record. The introduced Japanese skeleton shrimp ([*Caprella mutica*](#taxon:Caprella mutica)), reported for Galiano Island, is now well established along the coast of British Columbia. The invasive European green crab (*Carcinus maenas*) and two tanaids, *Leptochelia dubia* and *Zuexo normani*, have been found off Vancouver Island, but are not yet known locally. Additionally, the non-native amphipods *Ampithoe valida*, *Caprella drepanochir*, *Incisocalliope derzhavini*, *Melita nitida*, *Monocorophium acherusicum*, *Monocorophium insidiosum*, and *Jassa slatteryi*, along with the bay barnacle *Amphibalanus improvisus*, have all been reported in the Strait of Georgia, but have not yet been reported for Galiano Island.

## Community science contributions

Since the Biodiversity Galiano project began in 2016, our community has documented `r nrow(observed)` crustacean species in the waters around Galiano Island, [confirming](#region:confirmed) `r round((nrow(confirmed)/(nrow(confirmed)+nrow(reported))*100), digits = 0)` percent of the historical records and adding `r nrow(new)` [new species](#region:new) to the list. Of the `r nrow(reported) + nrow(confirmed)` historically reported taxa, `r nrow(reported)` species remain unconfirmed, having gone unreported in the last twenty years.

Many crustaceans are difficult to identify without microscopy, contributing to biases in the local record. Locally, [ichthyostracan](#taxon:Ichthyostraca) crustaceans are vastly under-represented and cladocerans and ostracods remain unrepresented to date. As of yet, there are no records of hoplocarids (mantis shrimps), ascothoracids or tantulocarids occurring within British Columbia. The latter two groups will likely be discovered with further investigation; hoplocarids, however, have never been observed north of southern California and are unlikely to occur in the region. Leptostracans are not well described, though at least one species from the genus *Nebalia* is known to the Northeast Pacific. Closer examination of subtidal and intertidal eelgrass, algae wrack and the rocky intertidal zone will uncover many unrecorded taxa.

## Crustaceans with Indigenous cultural significance

Crustaceans are one of many phyla that have cultural significance to Hul'qumi'num speaking peoples. Generally, crustaceans are regarded as important food sources for delicacy and cultural practice. 

* [Giant Barnacle](#taxon: Balanus nubilis), known in Hul'qumi'num as [**Qumine'**](#taxon:Balanus nubilis)
- Qumine' is regarded as an important and tasty delicacy, being roasted by fire making them an easier delicacy to enjoy.  

* [Red Rock Crab](#taxon: Cancer productus), known in Hul'qumi'num as [**Kwakwatl'shun**](#taxon:Cancer productus)
- Kwakwatl'shun is easier to find by provides less meat for the effort, hence, they are generally not a preferred species to consume but one consumed in times of need. 

* [Dungeness Crab](#taxon: Cancer magister), known in Hul'qumi'num as [**Ey'x**](#taxon:Cancer magister)
- Ey'x is an important food source, traditionally harvested with a 3-spronged spear. Some Elders have harvested ey'x by stepping ('umutsun) on ey'x barefoot and then placing them in a basket or canoe. 

* [Pacific Prawn](#taxon: Pandalus platyceros), known in Hul'qumi'num as [**Mam'ul' or  Maal-mul'**](#taxon:Pandalus platyceros)
- Mam'ul'are the largest shrimp species in the North Pacific, raching lengths of up to 25 cm. There is limited cultural information about Mam'ul', just that the Hul'qumi'num name has been documented.
